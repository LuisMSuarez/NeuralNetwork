Implementation of a Neural Network, with parallel execution of values as they flow through the network.

The motivation for this project came from reading the following article:
https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-llms-from-scratch-using-middle-school-math-e602d27ec876

As I read this article, I challenged myself to implement a model for the neural network, and an efficient implementation to allow values to flow from one layer to the next.
In the real world, this will be executed by algorithms that are optimized to execute on GPUs.
